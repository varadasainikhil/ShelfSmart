// TODO: 

// Important Questions/ Bugs -
// 1. Why are we creating a GroceryProduct in the manual entry and then a product. We can directly create product, because to store it locally we only need product.
// 2. Why are we saving the recipe in modelContext as soon we create a recipe model, we have to let the user choose whether they want to save it or not.
